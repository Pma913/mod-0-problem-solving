// 3. Given an array of strings, return only 
// the words that begin with the letter "t".

// -create an array of strings and only print elements that start with "t"
// -make at least 2 words start with the letter "t"
// -need to include a for loop
// -need to include an if statement that includes element and attach function
// -add a "startswith" to log

// Ran as expected. So I added an or statement as well (just for fun) so 
// we can take into account when folks forget to capitalize ðŸ˜ƒ
